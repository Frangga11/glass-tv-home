Glass TV debloats any Android TV or Google TV over Wi-Fi, with no root and nothing that can't be undone, then
swaps the ad-filled home screen for a light one in frosted glass, with a new set of places behind your apps
every week.

## What you get

- **Recent Apps & RAM Manager (Double-Press Home).** A native tvOS-style 3D CoverFlow app switcher and memory optimizer:
  - **Double-Press Home Button**: Double-pressing the remote's Home button from anywhere on the TV brings up the frosted glass Recent Apps deck.
  - **Double-Press Home to Close All**: Double-pressing Home again while inside the Recent Apps screen triggers `Close All` immediately—killing all background tasks and clearing memory in one step!
  - **Genuine Force-Stop Automation**: Integrates Accessibility automated force-stop to cleanly and completely terminate even stubborn foreground media apps (e.g. video players, streaming apps) that resist standard background process termination.
  - **Live RAM Gauge**: Real-time memory consumption display (`RAM 1.8 GB used of 2.3 GB`) with a sleek recessed progress bar.
  - **Individual App Dismissal**: Press `▲ (Up)` on any app card to slide it away, force-stop its process, and immediately reclaim RAM.
  - **Close All Button**: Click the circular `Close All` button (`🗑️`) at the end of the carousel to kill all running apps at once.
- **Weather & Air Quality Engine.** A full-screen Leanback weather hub (`WeatherActivity`) accessible directly from the under-clock pill:
  - Current condition, apparent temperature, humidity, wind velocity, UV index, sunrise and sunset times.
  - Air Quality Index (AQI / API / IPU) from Malaysia's Jabatan Alam Sekitar (APIMS) with a multi-color spectrum gauge, station comparisons, PM2.5 / PM10 readings, and health advisories.
  - Next 12 Hours hourly forecast pills and 7-day daily forecast cards with precipitation probabilities.
- **Islamic Prayer Timetable & Daily Ayat.** A mindful cultural shelf:
  - 6-phase timetable (Subuh, Syuruk, Zohor, Asar, Maghrib, Isyak) with emerald highlighting for the active prayer window.
  - Daily Quranic Ayat of the Day with Arabic calligraphy and translations.
- **StandBy Ambient Mode & Smart Energy Lifecycle.**
  - **10 Minutes Idle**: Automatically engages an ambient StandBy screensaver with large 110sp numerals, Islamic Hijri calendar, next prayer capsule, and a late-night red monochrome wind-down mode.
  - **2 Hours Later**: Automatically turns off the TV display into deep sleep standby via Android's Accessibility Service (`GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN`).

- **Keeps itself clean.** Every 15 days, while Home sits idle, the TV clears its app caches, where the Play
  Store leaves gigabytes of download leftovers that can make apps open to a blank screen. No computer needed,
  sign-ins and app data are never touched; the TV asks once to allow it.
- **Glass, like Apple's.** The dock's tray, the top-bar buttons and the menus show the picture behind them
  softened, with a shine along their edges. Android 10 has no live blur, so the picture is blurred once each
  time it changes and the glass draws its patch of it.
- **One selection that glides.** Between apps it is a pane of glass with the app's shadow under it; on the top
  bar and in the menus it is dark. It glides and changes shape from one to the next, never jumps.
- **Places to visit that renew themselves.** Once a week the TV takes the pictures Bing has shown on its home
  page over the past days — landmarks, landscapes, wildlife — deletes last week's and rotates through them,
  dimmed so the clock and tiles stay readable. The shelf above the dock names each one, its country and a few
  lines about it. Pictures with people in them are skipped: by the words in their caption, and by Android's
  own face detector on the TV. No key, no account, nothing to set up.
- **Every app tints the room.** The glow behind Home, and the glass with it, blends to the colour of whichever
  app is selected.
- **Arrange your apps from the remote.** Hold OK on an app for a glass menu with **Move** and **App info**.
  Move picks the app up: it wiggles, the arrows carry it (into or out of the dock too) and the other apps
  slide aside; OK puts it down. The order is kept, and apps installed later join at the end.
- **An Inputs menu in glass.** The selection glides out of the Inputs button into the list of HDMI and AV
  inputs, and Up from the top of the list glides it back.
- **Comes back as you left it.** Back from an app, the app you left is still selected; pressing Home on Home
  goes to the first app. When Android has closed Home to free memory, it comes back whole in one frame,
  with no black screen and no half-built dock.
- **A clock screensaver.** A grey analog dial with a yellow-orange second hand that ticks, the time and
  date beneath, drifting a little each minute so nothing burns in.
- **Rows feather out under the top bar** instead of being cut off when you scroll, and the Wi-Fi / Ethernet
  button can be hidden (`show_network_pill`).
- **Rotating wallpapers of your own** instead, with `"places": false`: put pictures in a theme's `wallpapers/`
  folder and choose how often they change, down to every 5 seconds. Each picture is decoded in the background
  and cross-faded.

Still light: on a Xiaomi Mi TV with 1.8 GB of RAM the launcher uses about 80–100 MB and stays there over hours
of use, one wallpaper is in memory at a time, the week's places take about 2 MB of storage, and nothing runs
while you are inside an app.

## Setting it up (Auto with AI or Manual)

**Using an AI coding agent** (Google Antigravity [Free], Claude Code [Paid], Cursor, Codex...)? Point it at this repository and ask it to debloat your TV, block ad tracking, and install Glass TV automatically! [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) guide any AI assistant safely step-by-step.

> - 🇲🇾 **[PANDUAN_PENGGUNA.md](PANDUAN_PENGGUNA.md)**: Panduan penuh Bahasa Melayu untuk pengguna baru (aktifkan Developer Mode, arahan AI, telefon pintar & FAQ).

The full step-by-step guide for debloating and installing is in
[docs/CLEANYOURTV-README.md](docs/CLEANYOURTV-README.md), and [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) lets a coding assistant do
it for you. In short:

```bash
python3 -m venv tools/venv && tools/venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
export TV_HOST=192.168.1.50                                   # your TV's IP address
tools/disable.sh examples/<your tv>/debloat.txt               # debloat
launcher/build-and-install.sh                                 # build the launcher and make it Home
tools/theme.sh themes/<your theme>                            # push your settings and wallpapers
```

Glass TV clears the TV's caches by itself every 15 days ([how](docs/cache-clean.md)). To clean several TVs
from one computer instead, [`tools/cache-clean.sh`](docs/cache-clean.md) finds the TVs on your network and
clears their caches, leaving sign-ins and app data untouched.

## Which TVs work

Android TV and Google TV, Android 8 or newer, on the TV or on a box plugged into any TV.
[docs/DEVICES.md](docs/DEVICES.md) lists every tested model and how far each was tested: end to end with
Glass TV, with the original launcher, or debloat only, plus what is expected to work and what cannot.

## LG and Samsung TVs

LG TVs run webOS and Samsung TVs run Tizen; neither can run Android apps, and neither lets any app replace its
home screen or the Home button. For the full Glass TV, plug in a Google TV or Android TV box (Chromecast with
Google TV, Xiaomi Mi Box, NVIDIA Shield): the TV becomes the screen and Glass TV is Home. On LG, a version you
open as an app is in preview in [webos/](webos/README.md).

## Places, or pictures of your own

Places are on from the start. To change how often the picture changes, or to use your own pictures and keep
the launcher offline, make a theme folder with a `config.json` like this and push it with `tools/theme.sh`:

```json
{
  "places": false,
  "wallpaper_seconds": 15,
  "show_network_pill": false
}
```

All keys are listed in [themes/README.md](themes/README.md). With `"places": false`, the launcher never goes
online.
