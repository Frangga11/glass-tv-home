## Latest resume checkpoint — 1 November 2026

- Current branch/head: `integration/b04-b05-reconciled` / `89d769689eb566671725c52982e0b73c4f1e8c31`; PR #15 is Draft/open. PR #13 and #14 remain source references.
- Static localization QC: 560 aligned resource keys; no duplicates, locale-key differences, or placeholder mismatches. Duplicate key detection was added to the unit test.
- App-wide source audit: 68 Java files and 17 layout XML files. 21 changed Java files with 534 `R.string` refs and 17 layouts with 71 `@string` refs; no unresolved references.
- Localization includes Settings, profile/app-lock PIN prompts, weather/location controls, avatar QR upload, wallpaper QR upload, Standby QR upload, and server-side upload errors/statuses.
- B04 exact-head CI #242 PASS. No integrated CI run/status is available for current head; no integrated build/test pass is claimed. Local substitute build unavailable (no Gradle/Android SDK; network DNS unavailable).
- Remaining mandatory gates: exact-head integrated CI; API 30 and API 33+ locale/configuration lifecycle; Activity/DreamService recreation and focus/tab retention; QR upload from real phone on same Wi-Fi; physical F02/F06 acceptance.
- Do not merge PR #15 or publish/install APK until all gates pass. No TV settings/packages changed.


## Final source checkpoint — 1 November 2026

- Integration head: `89d769689eb566671725c52982e0b73c4f1e8c31`; PR #15 is OPEN, DRAFT, and GitHub reports `mergeable_state=clean`. PR #13 and #14 are also OPEN/DRAFT. No merge has occurred.
- Localization static QC: 560 keys in default/ID/EN; zero duplicate keys, locale key differences, or placeholder mismatches. Duplicate-key rejection is now part of `LocalizationResourceParityTest`.
- App-wide scan: 68 Java files and 17 layout XML files; 21 changed Java files with 534 `R.string` refs and 17 layouts with 71 `@string` refs; zero unresolved references.
- B04 exact-head CI #242 passed. There is still no Actions run or combined status for the exact integration head. Do not treat `mergeable_state=clean` as a build/test result.
- Remaining gates are external: integrated CI; API 30/API 33+ runtime lifecycle/focus checks; phone-on-same-Wi-Fi QR upload verification; physical F02/F06 TV acceptance. No APK was published/installed and no TV settings were changed.


## Resume checkpoint — CI trigger and integration cleanup, 1 November 2026

- Current integration branch/head: `integration/b04-b05-reconciled` / `5e7481c4902c85352b1ab95b7f1ef41acdf9ed78`.
- PR #15: OPEN, Ready for review, mergeable=true; not merged. PR #13 and #14 remain source PRs; no merge has occurred.
- Root cause found: the previous `pull_request` workflow used default activity types, which omit `ready_for_review`; Draft → Ready did not start CI.
- CI workflow now explicitly includes `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, and `ready_for_review`; push validation also includes `integration/**` branches. Updated B04 base was merged into the integration branch with a two-parent commit, preserving history and restoring branch ancestry.
- Exact-head checks are still absent: no check runs or combined statuses are reported for `5e7481c4902c85352b1ab95b7f1ef41acdf9ed78`. Do not claim integrated CI success. B04 source CI #242 remains the only verified CI pass.
- Remaining gates: integrated CI evidence; Android API 30/API 33+ runtime lifecycle and focus; real-phone QR upload on same Wi-Fi; physical F02/F06 TV acceptance.
- No APK published/installed; no TV settings changed. Do not merge until every gate passes.


## Execution sequence update — 1 November 2026

- User confirmed: run CI now; defer physical device/TV tests until the final overall system test after B06/B07 and remaining planned B-series work.
- CI remains the immediate gate for B04/B05 integration. Exact-head workflow has not started; GitHub check-runs and combined status are empty for `5e7481c4902c85352b1ab95b7f1ef41acdf9ed78`.
- Workflow trigger configuration is corrected. Automatic PR reopen did not create a run; manual workflow dispatch is required from GitHub Actions → CI → Run workflow → branch `integration/b04-b05-reconciled`, with `publish_device_apk=false`.
- Once exact-head CI passes, finish the B04/B05 merge chain and proceed to B06/B07. Do not claim CI success before the run is green.
- Final system test (deferred, not waived): Android API 30/33+ lifecycle and focus; phone QR upload on same Wi-Fi; physical TV F02/F06. Keep a consolidated final acceptance matrix for the end of the B-series.

## B04/B05 integration completion — 1 November 2026

- Manual CI dispatch is now available from the default branch: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `main` includes `workflow_dispatch` (commit `6eaf787c56226606b1d2e650c59540c553756c62`). The user dispatched CI with `publish_device_apk=false`.
- Integrated B04+B05 CI passed on exact integration head `5932cf60e19640bc5fc648f43105f86c8752813c`: workflow run #254 (`41277076284`, PR event) and matching push run (`41277072693`) both SUCCESS. Jobs `Lists, tools and docs` and `Launcher build and unit tests` both passed. APK publish step was skipped; no device APK was published.
- CI exposed and fixes were committed on `integration/b04-b05-reconciled`: Android string apostrophe escaping in default/ID/EN resources; `AppUpdateManager` progress message now passes a localized `CharSequence`; `LocalizationResourceParityTest` compares placeholder lists with `List<String>`. Final integration head is `5932cf60e19640bc5fc648f43105f86c8752813c`.
- PR #15 merged into `feature/b04-responsive-layout` as `ec5ff4fce06fe0d2daf0e3fc49fe84fef9ad9838`. PR #13 then passed CI on exact head `ec5ff4fce06fe0d2daf0e3fc49fe84fef9ad9838` (run #256 (`41277353285`), SUCCESS) and merged into `feature/b03-dialog-opacity-layering` as `d7b76c4a22c9eadffb8171a616283f3ad647d488`.
- PR #14 is also CLOSED and GitHub reports it MERGED at `73817ce41e4ae5b034922f190052a95ac45886d9`; final B03 branch head after the merge chain is `d7b76c4a22c9eadffb8171a616283f3ad647d488`. Treat this final branch head as the current B-series continuation point.
- Exact CI evidence: https://github.com/Frangga11/glass-tv-home/actions/runs/41277076284 and https://github.com/Frangga11/glass-tv-home/actions/runs/41277353285.
- Deferred, not waived: Android API 30 and API 33+ lifecycle/configuration; Activity/DreamService recreation and focus/tab retention; real-phone QR upload on same Wi-Fi; physical TV F02/F06 acceptance. Perform these in the final overall system test after B06/B07 and remaining planned B-series work.
- No APK was published or installed; no device/TV settings were changed. B04/B05 merge chain is complete; next workstream may proceed to B06/B07.

## Resume checkpoint — B06 audit started, 1 November 2026

- B04/B05 integrated CI and merge chain completed; exact CI evidence is recorded in this file and the audit register.
- Current continuation head: `feature/b03-dialog-opacity-layering` / `d7b76c4a22c9eadffb8171a616283f3ad647d488`.
- Active B06 branch created: `feature/b06-notification-feedback`, based exactly on that continuation head.
- B06 baseline audit scanned 63 launcher Java files. Feedback is scattered across Toasts, AlertDialogs, one OTA ProgressDialog, and independent QR-page JavaScript statuses; no shared feedback helper/Snackbar was found. Transport timeouts differ by operation and must not be globally flattened.
- Next: complete B06 feedback inventory by grouping transient/info/success/error/loading/timeout and QR web states; design one consistent TV-safe, locale-aware pattern; implement with focused tests and exact-head CI. B07 remains NOT STARTED.
- Final runtime/phone QR/physical TV tests remain deferred to final overall B-series acceptance, not waived.
