## B04/B05 integration QC — latest checkpoint, 1 November 2026

- Integration branch `integration/b04-b05-reconciled`; exact head `89d769689eb566671725c52982e0b73c4f1e8c31`; Draft PR #15 targets B04 head. Source PR #13 and #14 remain open; no merge.
- B05 expanded beyond native Settings copy: profile/app-lock prompts, avatar QR page and HTTP errors, wallpaper/Standby QR pages and upload errors, weather mood picker, location setup, restart/power feedback, and radar illustration label now use Indonesian/English strings.
- Resource QC: 560 keys in default/ID/EN; zero duplicate keys, zero locale key-set differences, zero printf-placeholder mismatches. `LocalizationResourceParityTest` now fails on duplicate keys instead of silently overwriting them.
- App-wide scan covered all 68 Java files and all 17 layout XML files. Changed Java files: 21; 534 `R.string` references checked, zero missing. Layouts: 71 `@string` references checked, zero missing. No literal UI text remains in the 17 layouts except fixed weather preview values/location and the account branding handle.
- Remaining Java string literals are in language-aware ID/EN helper branches, weather-data descriptions/content metadata, internal protocol/system tokens, and dynamic values; they are not untranslated settings/control copy. Wallpaper catalogue titles/descriptions remain authored content, not control labels.
- B04 exact-head CI #242: PASS. Current integration head has no GitHub Actions workflow run or combined status; no integrated build/test pass is claimed. The connection exposes no workflow-dispatch action, and local environment has no Gradle/Android SDK or network access to run a substitute build.
- Runtime gates: API 30 locale/context/recreation; API 33+ per-app locale synchronization/configuration; Activity/DreamService lifecycle; settings tab and D-pad focus retention; QR upload on real phone/Wi-Fi; F02/F06 physical TV acceptance. No APK published/installed, no device settings changed.
- PR #15 remains Draft/unmerged pending exact-head CI and physical/runtime acceptance.
