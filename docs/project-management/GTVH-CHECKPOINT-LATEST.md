# GTVH-CHECKPOINT-LATEST
**Status:** CANONICAL / SINGLE ENTRY POINT  
**Checkpoint date:** 8 November 2026  
**Repository:** Frangga11/glass-tv-home  
**Canonical documentation branch:** `docs/project-master-inventory`  
**Canonical path:** `docs/project-management/GTVH-CHECKPOINT-LATEST.md`  
**Current Home implementation PR:** [PR #79](https://github.com/Frangga11/glass-tv-home/pull/79)  
**Latest documentation checkpoint commit:** this file's creation commit (branch tip after all supporting-file updates).

---

## 0. Mandatory restart rule — one source, one door

**Every future Glass TV Home session MUST begin by reading this file first.** This is the only canonical checkpoint entry point. Do not select a starting point from chat summaries, old checkpoint names, historical sections in other documents, PR descriptions, branch names, or previous APK artifacts.

Authority order:
1. This file: current checkpoint, decisions, active source candidate, outstanding gates, PR inventory and next actions.
2. The seven supporting project documents listed in Section 8: detailed history and supporting evidence only. Their older status statements are historical and are superseded by this checkpoint.
3. Source code and CI evidence at the exact SHAs stated here.
4. Other PRs/branches: candidate or historical work only until explicitly reconciled into the canonical path.

**Single source of truth:** GitHub repository + canonical docs branch above. ChatGPT conversation/memory is a pointer and convenience copy, never a competing source of project status. Do not create parallel checkpoint documents or alternate restart routes. Any future update must first update this file, then synchronize the supporting documents in the same documentation pass.

**Checkpoint invocation phrase:** “Lanjutkan Glass TV Home dari GTVH-CHECKPOINT-LATEST.”  
The response to this phrase must always load this exact file from `docs/project-management` on `docs/project-master-inventory` before any code change.

## 1. Current project state — authoritative snapshot

### Home Header / whole Home screen
- Workstream: `GTVH-HOME-HEADER-REFINEMENT-001` + whole-Home source cross-audit.
- Active source branch: `fix/home-balanced-frame-001`.
- Active PR: #79, OPEN / DRAFT / UNMERGED; base `fix/home-layout-consolidated-001` (PR #77).
- Current PR #79 HEAD: `c15e4383d7dd3f148b31a19f5e9b85423936b56d`.
- Implementation HEAD: `97f7e0c96d1c1dcd431cdc6edec31bf4837e11a5`.
- Test-only HEAD: `49f2777cee006a5afd50a33b85cb90a61a077e40`.
- Documentation-only PR-branch HEAD: `c15e4383d7dd3f148b31a19f5e9b85423936b56d`.
- PR #79 remains open, draft and unmerged. Do not merge or retarget without a separately verified reconciliation and owner authorization.

### Approved layout constraints — locked
- Safe frame: **29dp on top, bottom, left and right**. At Mi TV Stick logical density 320dpi (2px/dp), each edge = **58px**.
- Header navigation: **Home → Profile → Settings**, one shared glass capsule, each segment independently clickable/focusable.
- Header glass pill radius 21dp; shared nav capsule radius 20dp; inner segment radius 14dp.
- Preserve existing Dock/Grid card sizing, Grid sizing, app order, shelf content and established working behavior. Do not rework correct components to solve an unrelated issue.
- Header groups are aligned from measured geometry; no arbitrary independent offsets.
- Clock/date visual weight is reduced; time/date formatting and data logic remain unchanged.
- Indonesian/English Header labels and navigation behavior are covered by source contracts.
- Pagar Alam location metadata currently records 800m altitude.

## 2. Fixes completed and evidence

### HOME-001 through HOME-005
1. **HOME-001 Now Playing:** supported active media sessions remain eligible in PLAYING, PAUSED, BUFFERING and CONNECTING; playback icon reflects actual state.
2. **HOME-002 Prayer timetable:** visible timetable is focusable/clickable; click, DPAD Center and Enter open the detail popup; explicit DPAD routes include entry and return paths.
3. **HOME-003 Dock/Grid focus race:** generation-guarded deferred focus; stale callbacks invalidated on newer non-Grid destinations and lifecycle pause.
4. **HOME-004 Weather/AQI focus feedback:** scale and Header highlight are composed in one listener, preventing listener replacement/collision.
5. **HOME-005 atmospheric wallpaper overlay:** Home resume and active minute tick trigger a separate due-gated refresh; 15-minute due gate, overlap guard, dynamic-effects preference guard and refresh-on-enable behavior retained. This remains separate from the G3B Weather/AQI text cache.

### Home / Header source cross-audit
- 63 unique IDs in `activity_main.xml`; no duplicate ID declarations.
- Header actions: Home updates active tab; Profile opens profile popup; Settings opens quick-control popup.
- Location pill click and DPAD Center/Enter route to prayer-zone dialog.
- Weather/AQI click and DPAD routes checked at source level.
- Header center capsule width recomputes from measured left/right/header groups.
- Visible prayer table activation and navigation routes checked.
- Existing Home shelves, daily Ayah, prayer data, media card, app inventory, Dock behavior, wallpaper flow and profile/settings actions were reviewed for source preservation.
- Three additional regression contracts cover location click/DPAD, Home/Profile/Settings actions and Header width recalculation after measured-group changes.

## 3. CI / build — exact evidence

| Gate | Exact commit / run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation CI #1581 | `97f7e0c96d1c1dcd431cdc6edec31bf4837e11a5` / run `42486917618` | PASS; both required jobs, Android tests and release build |
| Test-only CI #1582 | `49f2777cee006a5afd50a33b85cb90a61a077e40` / run `42487572059` | PASS; 160 Python tests, 1 skipped; all 3 new tests passed; Android unit tests + release build |
| Docs-only tip CI #1583 | `c15e4383d7dd3f148b31a19f5e9b85423936b56d` / run `42487822397` | PASS; both jobs completed SUCCESS |

- Release APK diagnostic from CI #1582: **1,627,577 bytes**.
- Candidate test artifact: **#13619209786**. This is the latest candidate artifact recorded for the test-only source/test commit; no installation has occurred.
- CI #1583 validates a documentation-only PR tip; application source did not change after CI #1582.
- Release workflows #37/#38 published an older CI #1545 build for commit `c058935ed4398f5c7964d753fcf35a9cf77989bb`; they are **not** the current PR #79 candidate. Never mislabel those release assets as the latest build.

## 4. Acceptance status — do not overstate

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Source implementation and static cross-audit | PASS |
| HOME-001–HOME-005 source fixes | PASS |
| Automated Python regression suite | PASS (160, 1 skipped) |
| Android unit tests and release build | PASS |
| Latest docs-only CI #1583 | PASS |
| Rendered safe-frame / visual clipping on Mi TV Stick | PENDING |
| Full physical DPAD traversal / focus retention | PENDING |
| Runtime media, prayer, weather/AQI, overlay and lifecycle checks | PENDING |
| Runtime crash/log inspection | PENDING |
| Overall whole-Home acceptance | **PARTIAL — NOT FINAL** |

No APK installation, ADB session, physical Mi TV Stick test, device settings/default-launcher change, force-push or PR merge has been performed. These boundaries remain in force unless separately authorized.

## 5. PR inventory and consolidation control

GitHub currently reports **58 OPEN pull requests**. This is a repository-wide inventory, not a claim that all are active or all are defective. Several are stacked branches, parallel implementations, or historical drafts. Do not merge or close them blindly. Their code and dependencies must be compared with the canonical source path before disposition.

### Current Home consolidation cluster
- **#79** — active Home/Header candidate; current source/test/docs validation described above.
- **#77** — direct base/dependency of #79; consolidated Dock geometry and deterministic DPAD viewport work. Must be reviewed as the dependency, not merged automatically.
- **#78** — parallel H01 Header reskin branch based on `main`; competing/parallel Header work. Reconcile its unique changes against #79 before deciding superseded/retain.
- **#74, #75, #76** — earlier stacked Home/Dock layout branches. Compare their unique commits and test evidence with consolidated PR #77/#79; do not require merging all four as a chain and do not discard unreviewed unique work.

### All currently open PRs — immutable inventory snapshot
The table records the current GitHub head/base refs and head SHA prefix as observed during this checkpoint. It is an inventory for systematic reconciliation, not approval to merge.

**Disposition rule for every PR above:** classify as (A) already represented in canonical source, (B) unique changes to port/reconcile, (C) dependency needed by active work, (D) superseded duplicate to close only after diff/evidence review, or (E) unresolved defect requiring repair. Record the evidence, exact source SHA, CI status and decision in the audit register and decision log. No PR may be silently omitted. No PR is “completed” merely because it is Draft or old.

### Known dependency note
PR #79 is stacked on #77. Earlier comparison found one workflow-only commit after the common merge base on #77; it is not a functional source conflict. Preserve the dependency and reconcile ancestry before any merge; do not cherry-pick an equivalent workflow-only change just to make branch history look linear.

## 6. Single ordered next-work plan

1. **Freeze this checkpoint as the sole restart point.** Verify the canonical file and docs branch tip.
2. **PR reconciliation audit:** inspect all 58 open PRs and their unique diffs, dependencies, CI evidence and issue history. Start with #79/#77/#78/#74–76, then walk the remaining chains in dependency order.
3. **Build one canonical integration graph:** identify the authoritative branch/PR for each retained feature; eliminate duplicate/parallel paths only after proving their unique changes are represented or intentionally rejected.
4. **Resolve outstanding source defects:** only confirmed defects; narrow patches; add regression tests; CI on exact resulting HEAD.
5. **Synchronize documentation in one pass:** update this checkpoint first, then README, Master Project, Inventory, Decision Log, Audit Register, Handover and the dedicated audit report. All must point back here.
6. **Prepare physical acceptance only after source/CI/reconciliation gates pass** and after explicit owner authorization. Use the Mi TV Stick baseline: Android 11, 1920×1080, density 320dpi.
7. **Final merge/release decision:** only after dependencies, exact-head CI, PR reviews and device acceptance are all reconciled and owner-approved.

## 7. Quality-control rules — mandatory

- No speculative UI edits; preserve verified-good sizing, placement, behavior and app order.
- Never claim runtime/device acceptance from static source review or CI.
- Never use an older APK/release artifact as the current candidate.
- Never merge, close, force-push, install, ADB, or change device settings without explicit authorization.
- Record every source edit with branch + exact commit SHA + changed files + reason + tests + CI run + artifact.
- Record every unresolved issue with owner decision, severity, dependency and next action.
- Any stale or contradictory documentation must be corrected or explicitly marked historical; no parallel “latest” checkpoint.
- If any required evidence is unavailable, label the gate PENDING/UNKNOWN rather than infer PASS.

## 8. Supporting documents — detail only, not alternate entry points

All are on `docs/project-master-inventory` and must link back to this checkpoint:
- `README.md` — project overview and navigation.
- `MASTER_PROJECT.md` — goals, requirements, architecture and master history.
- `INVENTORY.md` — component/source inventory.
- `DECISION_LOG.md` — approved decisions and rationale.
- `AUDIT_REGISTER.md` — defects, evidence, remediation and dispositions.
- `HANDOVER.md` — operator handoff and restart procedure.
- `GTVH_HOME_SCREEN_CROSS_AUDIT_001.md` — detailed Home source cross-audit.
- PR-local `HOME_LAYOUT_RECONCILIATION_2026-11-08.md` is historical/implementation evidence only; it is not a restart point.

Supporting-document synchronization commits:

| README.md | `fb7922dec305bb278ddc0607c87f27637091a6b1` |

## 9. Final checkpoint decision

**Current source/CI result:** PASS within the stated boundaries.  
**Overall Home acceptance:** PARTIAL / NOT FINAL; physical Mi TV Stick acceptance remains pending.  
**Repository cleanup:** NOT FINAL; 58 open PRs require evidence-based reconciliation.  
**Documentation architecture:** one canonical checkpoint entry point established by this file; supporting documents are subordinate detail/history.

**Next session must start here and nowhere else.**
