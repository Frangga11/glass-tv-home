### 📋 Step 1: Turn On Developer Mode & Debugging on Your TV
Before AI can reach your TV over Wi-Fi, enable developer options on your Android TV:
1. On your TV remote, open **Settings ⚙️**.
2. Select **Device Preferences** (or **System** on newer Google TVs).
3. Select **About**.
4. Scroll down until you find **Build** (or **Android TV OS Build**).
5. **Press the OK button on your remote 7 times rapidly** until a toast notification appears: *"You are now a developer!"*.
6. Press the *Back* button once. You will now see a new menu: **Developer options**.
7. Open *Developer options*, locate and **ENABLE**:
   - ✅ **USB debugging** (Turn ON).
   - ✅ **Network debugging / Wireless debugging** (if available on your TV model).
8. Find your TV's local IP address under **Settings $\rightarrow$ Network & Internet** (e.g. `192.168.68.102` or `192.168.1.50`).

---

### 📋 Step 2: Give This Prompt to Your AI Assistant
Open **Google Antigravity**, **Claude Code**, or **Cursor** on your computer/laptop connected to the **same home Wi-Fi network as your TV**. Copy and paste the prompt below:

```text
Please install Glass TV from repository https://github.com/aqmangge/glass-tv-home on my Android TV.
My TV model: [Insert your TV brand & model, e.g., Xiaomi Mi Box S]
My TV IP address: [Insert your TV IP, e.g., 192.168.68.102]

Please execute the following tasks automatically:
1. Connect to my TV over Wi-Fi using ADB (port 5555).
2. Create a backup of my TV's current app list and settings into the backup folder.
3. Optimize & Debloat (Remove Ads & Telemetry):
   - Disable manufacturer bloatware, sponsored promotional ads (such as Xiaomi PatchWall or Google TV launcher ads), and background analytics services using 'pm disable-user --user 0'.
   - Do NOT disable critical system services (keep HDMI, Bluetooth remote, Google Play Store, audio, and Wi-Fi intact).
4. Configure AdGuard Private DNS (dns.adguard-dns.com) to block ads and trackers at the system DNS level.
5. Compile/build the Glass TV Home APK and install it as the default home launcher.
6. Enable HomeKeyService so the remote Home button returns to Glass TV and the 2-hour sleep standby timer functions.
7. Capture a live screenshot from the TV and display it to confirm everything succeeded smoothly.
```

### 📋 Step 3: Click "Allow" on Your TV Screen
When the AI initiates the connection, a authorization prompt will pop up on your TV screen:
* *"Allow USB debugging from this computer?"*
* Check the box: ☑ **"Always allow from this computer"**
* Select **OK / Allow**.

The AI will handle everything else: clearing sluggish bloatware, enabling the ad blocker, deploying Glass TV Home, and showing you a screenshot of your clean, responsive TV!

---

### ↩️ How to Undo / Restore Original Launcher
All modifications made by the AI are **100% safe and reversible**:
* The AI disables apps rather than permanently deleting system packages.
* An automatic restore script (`restore.sh` / `restore.ps1`) is saved.
* If you ever wish to return to the manufacturer's original launcher, just prompt the AI:
  > *"Please restore my TV back to the original factory launcher and settings."*

## 📲 5. Mobile Phone Setup (Without Any PC / Laptop)

You do **not** need a computer to install Glass TV Home.

### Method 1: Android Phone via 'Bugjaeger' (Install APK + Debloat Directly)
The **Bugjaeger Mobile ADB** app (free on Google Play Store) allows your phone to act as an ADB controller over Wi-Fi:

1. Connect both phone and TV to the **same Wi-Fi**.
2. Open **Bugjaeger**, tap the **Connect 🔌** icon, enter your TV IP (e.g. `192.168.68.102:5555`), and tap **Connect**.
3. Accept the *"Allow USB debugging"* prompt on your TV screen.
4. Go to the **Packages 📦** tab in Bugjaeger, tap **+**, and select the downloaded `app-release.apk` to install it directly.
5. In the **Commands ⚡** tab, run these commands to block ads and debloat:
   ```bash
   settings put global private_dns_specifier dns.adguard-dns.com
   settings put global private_dns_mode hostname
   pm disable-user --user 0 com.mitv.tvhome
   pm disable-user --user 0 com.xiaomi.mitv.advertise
   ```

---

### Method 2: iPhone (iOS) Users: Can You Use an iPhone?
**Yes! You can easily install the APK and block ads on your TV using an iPhone.**

Due to Apple App Store sandbox security policies, Apple does not allow direct low-level ADB tools like Bugjaeger on iOS. However, iPhone users can achieve a clean setup quickly:

#### 1. Transfer & Install the APK using 'LocalSend':
* Download the free **LocalSend** app on your iPhone (App Store) and on your Android TV (Play Store).
* Download `app-release.apk` on your iPhone Safari from this GitHub repository.
* Open LocalSend on both devices (on the same Wi-Fi) and send the APK to your TV in 1 tap.
* On your TV, click the received APK file and select **Install**.

#### 2. Block Ads & Telemetry Directly from Your TV Remote (No ADB Needed):
1. On your TV, navigate to **Settings ⚙️** $\rightarrow$ **Network & Internet**.
2. Select **Private DNS** (switch from *Automatic* to *Private DNS provider hostname*).
3. Type:
   ```text
   dns.adguard-dns.com
   ```
4. Click **Save**. All system-wide banner ads, manufacturer analytics, and tracking domains will be blocked immediately!

#### 3. Deep Debloat Note for iPhone Users:
To disable deep manufacturer system packages (e.g., Xiaomi PatchWall), it is recommended to run the ADB command once from a computer, or borrow an Android phone for 2 minutes. Once disabled, the bloatware remains gone permanently.

## 🛠️ 6. Alternative: Manual Installation via USB Flash Drive

If you prefer using a physical USB drive:
1. Download `app-release.apk` onto your USB drive.
2. Plug the USB flash drive into your Android TV or Xiaomi Mi Box.
3. Open any file explorer app on the TV (e.g., *File Commander* or *FX File Explorer* from Google Play Store).
4. Click `app-release.apk` and select **Install** (allow *"Install unknown apps"* if prompted).
5. Press the **Home** button on your remote and choose **Glass TV Home** as *Always*.

## ❓ 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Can I run Claude Code on a mobile phone (iOS / Android), and does the iOS sandbox block local network access?
* **CLI / Node.js Requirement:** Claude Code (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) is an interactive terminal tool that requires a full **Node.js 18+** shell environment. iOS sandbox policies strictly forbid running Node.js engines and local arbitrary shell executables directly on an iPhone.
* **Cloud vs Local Network Barrier:** Claude Code or any cloud-hosted AI (e.g., web Claude or web ChatGPT) executes on remote cloud servers. Cloud servers **CANNOT enter your private home Wi-Fi network** to access your TV's private IP (`192.168.x.x`) due to your home router's NAT firewall.
* **Solution:** ADB commands must be initiated by a local device on your home Wi-Fi (such as a laptop/PC running Google Antigravity or Claude Code, or an Android phone running Bugjaeger).

---

### Q2: Is there an AI that can install and do all tasks directly without the user installing the APK manually?
* **YES, when run on a computer/laptop on the same Wi-Fi (Google Antigravity / Claude Code / Cursor):**
  The AI connects to the TV over wireless ADB (`adb connect 192.168.x.x`), builds the APK, installs it, removes bloatware, and verifies everything with automated screenshots. The user does not need to touch or open any APK file manually!
* **On mobile phones without a PC:** You simply use a helper app (Bugjaeger on Android, or LocalSend on iPhone) to transfer and install the APK.

---

### Q3: If a user only installs the APK file, do they have full access with the TV remote, or do they still need AI access?
* **100% STANDALONE! YOU ONLY NEED YOUR TV REMOTE, ZERO AI REQUIRED!**
* Glass TV Home is a **native Android TV application** (Native Kotlin/AndroidX).
* Once the APK is installed on the TV:
  - **Full Remote Control**: The D-Pad (Up/Down/Left/Right/OK), Back, and Home buttons navigate everything natively.
  - **All smart features run locally**: Clock, Hijri dates, prayer timetable, weather & AQI (APIMS), 10-minute screensaver, and 2-hour auto sleep operate entirely inside the TV without requiring an AI agent, computer, or active subscription.
  - Family members and non-technical users can use the TV just like a standard commercial smart TV.
* **The AI's role is purely as a "mechanic/technician"** during the initial setup to automate installation and debloating. Once installed, Glass TV Home is 100% independent.
